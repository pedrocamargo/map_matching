geoprocessing parameters:
  buffer size: 0.0016 #Buffer around the links to capture links likely used. Unit is degrees
                      # Each 0.0001 correspond to approximately 11m (36ft) in the radius of the buffer
  azimuth tolerance: 22.5  # In case the network and the GPS data have azimuths, this is the tolerance to be used to
                           # to define if a GPS ping could have used a certain link

network file fields:
  link_id: id
  direction: dir
  cost: length
  interpolation: length

  # Optional fields. Fill with 0 if not applicable
  azimuth: AUTO  #For on-the-fly computation, use AUTO
  speed_AB: 0
  speed_BA: 0

nodes file fields:
  node_id: node_id

data quality:
  max_speed: 130    # in kmph
  max_speed_time: 120      # in seconds   --> time that the truck needs to be above the speed limit to be scraped
  minimum_pings: 20 # Minimum number of pings that the vehicle needs to have to be considered valid
  minimum_coverage: 2 # Minimum diagonal of the Bounding box (km) defined by the GPS pings to be considered a valid vehicle

stops parameters:
# Time in seconds
# Distance in km. Measured as Great circle distance between each consecutive ping
  Maximum space:
    time: 10800
    min distance: 5
    max distance: 20

# This is the algorithm commonly used for ATRI truck GPS data. Initially developed by Pinjari et. Al and improved by
# Camargo, Hong and Livshits (2017)
  Delivery stop:
    stopped speed: 8  # in km/h
    min time stopped: 300 # 5*60 in seconds   --> minimum stopped time to be considered
    max time stopped: 14400 # 4*60*60 in seconds   --> maximum stopped time to be considered
    max stop coverage: 0.8 # in kilometers

map matching:
# map matching related parameters
  cost discount: 20 # possibly used link cost reduction ratio
